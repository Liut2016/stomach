When\n * an Observable returned by the operator is subscribed, condition function will be called.\n * Based on what boolean it returns at that moment, consumer will subscribe either to\n * the first Observable (if condition was true) or to the second (if condition was false). Condition\n * function may also not return anything - in that case condition will be evaluated as false and\n * second Observable will be subscribed.\n *\n * Note that Observables for both cases (true and false) are optional. If condition points to an Observable that\n * was left undefined, resulting stream will simply complete immediately. That allows you to, rather\n * then controlling which Observable will be subscribed, decide at runtime if consumer should have access\n * to given Observable or not.\n *\n * If you have more complex logic that requires decision between more than two Observables, {@link defer}\n * will probably be a better choice. Actually `if` can be easily implemented with {@link defer}\n * and exists only for convenience and readability reasons.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Change at runtime which Observable will be subscribed</caption>\n * let subscribeToFirst;\n * const firstOrSecond = Rx.Observable.if(\n *   () => subscribeToFirst,\n *   Rx.Observable.of('first'),\n *   Rx.Observable.of('second')\n * );\n *\n * subscribeToFirst = true;\n * firstOrSecond.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // \"first\"\n *\n * subscribeToFirst = false;\n * firstOrSecond.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // \"second\"\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Control an access to an Observable</caption>\n * let accessGranted;\n * const observableIfYouHaveAccess = Rx.Observable.if(\n *   () => accessGranted,\n *   Rx.Observable.of('It seems you have an access...') // Note that only one Observable is passed to the operator.\n * );\n *\n * accessGranted = true;\n * observableIfYouHaveAccess.subscribe(\n *   value => console.log(value),\n *   err => {},\n *   () => console.log('The end')\n * );\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // \"It seems you have an access...\"\n * // \"The end\"\n *\n * accessGranted = false;\n * observableIfYouHaveAccess.subscribe(\n *   value => console.log(value),\n *   err => {},\n *   () => console.log('The end')\n * );\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // \"The end\"\n *\n * @see {@link defer}\n *\n * @param {function(): boolean} condition Condition which Observable should be chosen.\n * @param {Observable} [trueObservable] An Observable that will be subscribed if condition is true.\n * @param {Observable} [falseObservable] An Observable that will be subscribed if condition is false.\n * @return {Observable} Either first or second Observable, depending on condition.\n * @static true\n * @name iif\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function iif(condition, trueResult, falseResult) {\n    if (trueResult === void 0) {\n        trueResult = EMPTY;\n    }\n    if (falseResult === void 0) {\n        falseResult = EMPTY;\n    }\n    return defer(function () { return condition() ? trueResult : falseResult; });\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=iif.js.map\n",null]}
